# Generative Computer Graphics
This documentation shows and explains my sketches and works which I made for the module «Generative Computer Graphics» at the Hochschule Luzern.
«Generative Computer Graphics» is a module, in which we were able to work on individual projects by programming algorithms to create generative art. We were free to create whatever art we wanted as long as it was generative. We mostly worked with the Javascript library «p5».
This module was supervised by Guillaume Massol.
